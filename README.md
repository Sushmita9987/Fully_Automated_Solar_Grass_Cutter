# Fully_Automated_Solar_Grass_Cutter
The fully automated solar grass cutter is a fully automated
grass-cutting robotic vehicle powered by solar energy that also
avoids obstacles and is capable of fully automated grass-cutting without the need of any human interaction. The system
uses 6V batteries to power the vehicle movement motors as
well as the grass cutter motor. We also use a solar panel to
charge the battery so that there is no need of charging it
externally. The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced
with an 8051 family microcontroller that controls the working of
all the motors. It is also interfaced with an ultrasonic sensor for
object detection. The microcontroller moves the vehicle
motors in a forward direction in case no obstacle is detected. On
obstacle detection the ultrasonic sensor monitors it and the
microcontroller thus stops the grass cutter motor to avoid any
damage to the object/human/animal whatever it is.
Microcontroller then turns the robotic as long as it gets clear
of the object and then moves the grass cutter forward
direction again.

Introduction

Nowadays pollution is a major issue for whole world.
Pollution is manmade and can be seen in own homes. In case
Gas powered lawn mowers due to the emission of gases it is
responsible for pollution. Also the cost of fuel is increasing
hence it is not efficient. So the Solar powered grass cutters are
introduced. Solar powered lawn mower can be described as
the application of solar energy to power an electric motor
which in turn rotates a blade which does the mowing of a
lawn. But the cost of those grass cutters is high. But our
automatic grass cutter is consisting of rechargeable battery.
This design is alternative for environmentally hazardous gas
powered grass cutter. Hydrogen powered lawn mower has
been operated without major interruption during the past
fourteen years. The commercial model was originally running
on gasoline and was adapted to hydrogen by making small
adjustments to the carburettor and by installing a hydrogen
reservoir containing solid-state metal hydrides. During the
evaluation period the only maintenance work was changing
the lubricating oil of the engine once a year, and reactivating
the metal hydride powder by external heating after an

accidental inlet of air into the reservoir. And also it will be the
alternative for solar powered automatic grass cutter because
its cost is more. So automatic grass cutter using rechargeable
battery is economically helpful for user. By using this
automatic grass cutter user can the cut the grass of the
required area by giving input by using keypad. Also the height
of grass can be specified by adjusting the height of blades.
The main objective of this grass cutter is that the grass in the
lawn must be mown with less effort. Also to cut the grass of
particular area as per user requirement. The sensors are the
eyes of this grass cutter. The other objective is that the
automatic grass cutter has to differentiate between grass and
concrete while monitoring its surroundings continuously. We
wanted an ultrasonic sensor to detect if the grass cutter was
heading into an object. Safety is the main concern while
designing the grass cutter. As it has blades we wanted our
grass cutter not to be in operating mode if it was being held in
the air by the user. Knowing that the user would be randomly
holding the grass cutter we needed a sensor to detect
orientation. The accelerometer was hence used in grass cutter
so that it will not operate when user hold it. An automatic

grass cutter will relieve the consumer from mowing their own
lawns and will reduce both environmental and noise pollution.
An automatic lawn cutter that will help the user to cut the
grass in their lawn with less efforts. The different sensors are
used it will detect and avoid objects and humans while
mowing. The main objective of this automatic lawn cutter is
that the user can specify the area that is to be mown and also
the height of grass as per there requirement by using the
keypad. This design contains a microcontroller like ATmega,
multiple sensors, Solar Panel, Motors, Chassis etc. This
project provides a design method of an automated lawn
mower, whose task is to cut grass whilst following a specified
pattern with no need of user interaction. This task is expected
to be made possible by using sensors to provide a
microcontroller with measurement of distance.
Solar Energy
Solar energy is very large, inexhaustible source of energy.
The power from the sun interrupted by earth is approximately
1.8/10MW, which are many thousands of times larger than the
present consumption rate on the earth of all energy sources.

The quantum of energy India’s land area receive from sun is
equivalent to 15,000 time sits consumption requirement (500
billion kWh) as projected for 2004. In addition to its size,
solar energy has two other factors in its favor. Firstly, unlike
fossil fuels and nuclear power, it is an environmentally clean
source of energy. Secondly, it is free and available in adequate
quantities in almost all parts of the world people live. But
there are some problems associated with its. The real
challenge in utilizing solar energy is of and economic
concern.
One has to strive for the development of cheaper methods of
collection and storage so that large initial investments
required at preset in most applications are reduced, solar
energy in India:
A large amount of solar radiation fall on India and for most of
the country very few days are without sunshine. India lies
within the latitude of 7 N to and 37 N with annual average
intensity of solar radiation as500 to 600 cal/cm/day with more
such insulations available in arid and semi arid regions.
Average solar radiation falling on India in arid and semiarid
regions is 7.5 K w h/m/day. Solar energy 5× 10 K w h/year

potential to meet basic energy needs of teeming millions who
live in rural India.
Solar energy is an important, clean, cheap and abundantly
available renewable energy. The sun radiates heat and light.
The heat, light received from the sun supports the
environment on the earth through the following well known
natural effects.
 Temperature balance on the earth
 Photo-synthesis by biological plantsm production of
oxygen and organic materials, production of organic
chemicals and biomass.
 Wind due to unequal heating of water, land surfaces.
Heating of ocean water: ocean thermal energy (OTEC)
 Waves in ocean: ocean wave energy
 Tides in ocean: ocean tidal energy (due to gravitational
forces)
The sun produces enormous amount of energy of heat and
light through sustained nuclear fusion reactions. The solar
energy received on the earth in the form of radiation is used
for heating and producing an electrical energy.
